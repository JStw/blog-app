Welcome to the BlogApp project.

This project was referring to an article in my personal blog to interface with AWS Api Gateway and AWS Lambda functions.

Before starting the app, please edit the App.tsx file and put your AWS Api Gatewway base url to make it works.

Edit the `App.js` and put your Api Gateway base url.

Then you can run a `npm install` and `npm start` to run the app :)

For the following tutorial, please make sure that your app is listening on port 3000 and your API Gateway authorize origins from http://localhost:3000.

Let's test :)
